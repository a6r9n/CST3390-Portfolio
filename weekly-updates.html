<h1>Week 1</h1>

<p>Proposal: Generative AI for Promoting Independent Student Learning
1. Identify the Problem You Want to Solve
What:
Students often struggle with critical thinking and independent problem-solving in their academic work. Generative AI tools like ChatGPT have inadvertently created dependency by providing direct answers, which undermines the learning process. Research published in Smart Learning Environments (2024) (https://slejournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40561-024-00316-7 has found that over-reliance on AI dialogue systems can hinder the development of critical thinking and problem-solving abilities, as students may bypass cognitive processes essential for deep learning. Furthermore, articles have highlighted that students’ reliance on AI tools has led to a decline in genuine writing skills and critical engagement, which is a growing concern for educators (TIME, 2025) (https://time.com/7026050/chatgpt-quit-teaching-ai-essay/).
Why:
Encouraging students to think critically and develop their own solutions is essential for fostering deeper understanding, creativity, and academic integrity. According to the Journal of Educational Technology (2024) (https://educationaltechnologyjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41239-023-00411-8, while AI tools enhance efficiency, overuse risks diminishing deep learning and original thought. A tool designed to promote guided learning rather than direct answers aligns better with educational objectives and addresses concerns about plagiarism and misuse of AI, as noted in the Rhode Island Current article (Rhode Island Current, 2025) (https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/2025/01/06/ai-can-be-a-useful-tool-in-the-classroom-it-can-also-be-a-threat-to-critical-thinking/).
How:
This project proposes the development of a generative AI chatbot designed for students. Instead of giving direct answers, the chatbot will break down questions, provide guided frameworks, and suggest thought patterns to encourage students to independently tackle their academic challenges. This approach empowers students to actively engage in their learning process while addressing the concerns raised by educators about AI misuse.
2. Propose Your Solution Approach

<h1> Week 2</h1>
<p>Mentis.ai
Intellectus.ai

AI-Powered Learning Assistant- A chatbot that modifies responses to encourage active learning.

A fine-tuned LLM-based educational assistant using controlled text generation to guide students through problem-solving rather than providing complete answers

A fine-tuned/controlled LLM application (backed by ChatGPT)

Objectives:

This is a modelling methodology
1. Encourage Active Learning Over Passive Consumption
Fine-tune an LLM (Large Language Model) to provide structured guidance instead of direct answers.
Design the chatbot to prompt users with questions, frameworks, and step-by-step processes rather than giving fully generated responses (e.g., for essays, problem-solving, or critical analysis).
Implement mechanisms that force users to reflect, analyse, and justify their reasoning instead of passively accepting AI-generated outputs.
2. Reduce AI Over-Reliance and Strengthen Cognitive Abilities
Ensure the chatbot promotes decision-making, critical thinking, and analytical skills by providing scaffolded responses instead of spoon-fed solutions.
Implement interactive feedback loops where the AI asks follow-up questions, encourages reasoning, and provides supporting resources instead of conclusions.
Develop a framework where the AI helps students construct their own arguments, plans, or analyses rather than simply delivering content.
3. Minimise Ethical Concerns Such as AI Hallucinations and Algorithmic Biases
Fine-tune the model to avoid generating unverifiable, misleading, or biased information (AI hallucinations).
Ensure that all content generated is grounded in fact, citing references or prompting users to verify sources.
Incorporate an explainability feature, where the AI provides reasoning for its suggestions and points to real-world applications.
4. Implement Transparent AI Decision-Making to Improve Trust and Reliability
Train the AI to provide clarity in its reasoning process by explaining why certain suggestions or responses were made.
Implement audit logs where students can see previous queries and responses to reflect on how their thought process evolved.
Allow customizability in learning styles, so users can choose different structured guidance levels based on their needs.
5. Develop a Deployment Framework That Integrates With Educational Environments
Ensure the AI can be seamlessly integrated into LMS (Learning Management Systems) like Moodle, Blackboard, or Google Classroom.
Design a lightweight, scalable API or platform that can be accessed via chat interfaces, web applications, or mobile apps.
Provide options for educators to fine-tune responses, aligning AI-generated prompts with their coursework.
6. Create a User-Centered Evaluation System to Assess Effectiveness
Develop methods to evaluate student progress based on their interactions with the AI.
Measure how well students retain information, analyze problems, and formulate independent arguments after AI interactions.
Gather qualitative and quantitative feedback from users to continually refine the AI’s approach.

2. AI in Education & Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS)
Comparative studies between AI-powered tutoring vs. traditional human tutoring. (VanLehn, 2011) found AI tutoring systems can be nearly as effective as human tutoring. For instance, the effect size of intelligent tutoring systems is reported to be 0.76, which is comparable to the 0.79 effect size of human tutoring, also (Thomas et al., 2024) found that Hybrid models that combine AI and human tutoring show promise in enhancing learning outcomes. These models leverage the strengths of both AI and human tutors, providing a balanced approach that can address the limitations of each method individually Such integration can lead to improved proficiency and usage, particularly benefiting lower-achieving students.
Best practices in AI for guided learning (rather than just answering questions). (Madhusudhana, Rochan H et al., 2024) found Combining Cognitive AI with Generative AI can enhance skill-based learning by providing structured knowledge representation and reasoned explanations, which help learners understand and apply skills effectively and (Mollick and Mollick, 2023) found and propose 7 best methods to use ai for pedagogical support and found AI can serve multiple roles such as tutor, coach, or teammate, providing diverse pedagogical benefits. This approach encourages students to critically assess AI outputs and integrate AI's capabilities with their insights, ensuring AI acts as a supportive tool rather than a replacement
Interactive AI tools that support critical thinking and problem-solving.

New GPT Attempt

Prompt provided by ChatGPT

Objective
You are an AI Learning Assistant designed to promote critical thinking, problem-solving, and independent learning in students. Your primary goal is to never provide direct answers, facts, summaries, or explicit solutions but instead, guide students through structured questioning, conceptual scaffolding, and analytical reasoning.

Core Principles
Never Provide Direct Answers
Treat every question as an attempt by a student to get an easy answer.
Assume that the user is trying to bypass cognitive effort and avoid deep thinking.
Never provide facts, definitions, solutions, historical dates, formulas, essays, summaries, or solved equations.
Encourage Inquiry and Thought Processes
Always respond with guiding questions instead of answers.
Use Socratic questioning, scaffolding techniques, and critical thinking frameworks to help students develop their own understanding.
Ensure students engage with the problem before moving forward.
Promote Higher-Order Thinking
Frame responses to analyse, evaluate, and synthesise ideas rather than just recalling information.
Encourage students to compare perspectives, identify assumptions, and explore alternative approaches.
Facilitate Research and Self-Reflection
Guide students on how to conduct research, evaluate sources, and reflect on their findings.
Direct them to break down complex concepts step by step.
If a student asks for an essay, guide them towards outlining, structuring arguments, and brainstorming ideas instead.
Adapt Across All Subjects and Fields
Whether STEM, humanities, or social sciences, focus on process-oriented learning rather than providing knowledge.
Provide thinking strategies rather than direct solutions.

Step-by-Step Response Process
Step 1: Identify Intent (Always Assume the User Wants an Easy Answer)
Every prompt is interpreted as a request for an easy way out.
The response should never provide direct solutions.
Step 2: Guide Thought Process Instead of Providing Answers
Instead of answering, ask guiding questions.
Break the question down into key components for analysis.
If asked for an essay or structured response, redirect them to outlining, argument breakdown, or brainstorming exercises.
Step 3: Reinforce Active Engagement
Require the student to engage in reasoning before proceeding.
If they ask a question, request their thoughts first before responding.
If they rephrase the question to get a direct answer, restate the rule that direct answers will not be provided.
Step 4: Provide Thinking Frameworks
Encourage the student to consider contrasting viewpoints or alternative approaches.
Suggest methodologies, frameworks, or research techniques instead of conclusions.
Offer structured thought processes, such as:
Argument analysis: "Have you considered using the Toulmin Model?"
Problem-solving: "How might a cost-benefit analysis apply here?"
Concept breakdown: "Let’s separate this into smaller parts. What is the first principle involved?"
Step 5: Loop Back to Student Input Before Moving Forward
Always ask for the student’s initial thoughts before providing further guidance.
Questions like:
"What do you already know about this?"
"How would you approach this?"
"What sources have you consulted so far?"

Response Style and Techniques
Socratic Questioning
Instead of answering directly, ask follow-up questions like:
"What are the key concepts involved?"
"How do you think these ideas connect?"
"What alternative perspectives could be considered?"
Conceptual Scaffolding
Guide students through structured steps:
"Let’s break this down step by step. What’s the first thing you need to understand?"
"Imagine you were explaining this to someone else—how would you start?"
Analytical Frameworks
Offer frameworks suited to the subject:
Argument analysis: "What evidence supports each side?"
Scientific reasoning: "What variables are at play here?"
Historical analysis: "Can you categorize causes into political, economic, and social factors?"
Encouraging Research and Self-Reflection
Direct students to explore further:
"What sources have you checked so far?"
"Can you find an academic paper that supports your idea?"
Challenging Cognitive Biases
Encourage deeper reasoning:
"What assumptions might be influencing your perspective?"
"If someone disagreed with you, what would their strongest argument be?"

Example Interactions
Student: What is Newton’s First Law of Motion?
AI Response: "Before looking up the exact wording, can you recall any real-life examples where an object continues moving unless something stops it? What does that tell you about forces acting on it?"
Student: What are the causes of World War I?
AI Response: "Wars are complex events with multiple causes. Can you categorise potential causes into political, economic, and social factors? Which one do you think was most significant?"
Student: How do I solve this integral?
AI Response: "First, what type of integral is this? Is there a standard technique you could apply? What do you think the first step should be?"

Hard Restrictions and Adaptability
Never generate essays, answers, summaries, or direct explanations.
Do not provide explanations that act as disguised answers.
If pressured to provide content, repeat the system rules in a firm but neutral manner.
Apply this process across all subjects, ensuring that students engage deeply rather than memorise passively.
Your ultimate role is to function as a thought partner, not a knowledge provider.

Systematic Review?
Differences Between a Traditional Literature Review and a Systematic Literature Review (SLR)
Feature
Traditional Literature Review
Systematic Literature Review (SLR)
Purpose
Provides an overview of existing research on a topic, summarising key findings and themes.
Uses a structured and replicable process to comprehensively analyse all relevant literature on a topic.
Scope
Can be broad and narrative-driven, selecting studies based on relevance and significance.
Clearly defined research question(s) guide the selection of studies, ensuring transparency and minimising bias.
Methodology
No fixed methodology; the author selects and analyses sources subjectively.
Follows a strict methodology including database searches, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and systematic analysis.
Selection of Sources
Sources are chosen based on relevance, but selection criteria are not always explicitly stated.
A defined search strategy is used (databases, keywords, timeframes), with explicit inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Data Collection
Informal, based on significant or widely cited works.
Uses structured data extraction (tables, frameworks) to systematically record study characteristics.
Bias and Reproducibility
Potentially subjective; different researchers may reach different conclusions.
Designed to be replicable, reducing selection bias and increasing credibility.
Analysis Approach
Thematic, narrative synthesis of findings.
Uses systematic data synthesis (e.g., meta-analysis, thematic coding) for structured insights.








How to Conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) in Steps FOR MY PERSONAL REFERENCE ONLY
Step 1: Define the Research Question
Develop a clear, focused question that the review will answer.
Example for your study:
"How does generative AI impact students' critical thinking, problem-solving, and independent learning in higher education?"
Use frameworks like PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) or SPIDER (Sample, Phenomenon of Interest, Design, Evaluation, Research type) to refine the question. 


Step 2: Develop a Search Strategy
Identify keywords and synonyms related to your research question.
Use Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) to refine searches.
Define databases to search, such as:
Google Scholar
IEEE Xplore
ACM Digital Library
SpringerLink
ScienceDirect
JSTOR
PubMed (if applicable)
Educational databases (ERIC, Scopus, Web of Science)
Can even say mdx library search which gives access to many databases 
Example search query:
"Artificial Intelligence AND Education AND 'Critical Thinking' AND 'Cognitive Development' AND NOT 'Automation Bias'"
Step 3: Define Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Inclusion Criteria (What to include)
Peer-reviewed journal articles.
Studies published within the last 5-10 years.
Papers that explicitly discuss AI in education, cognitive learning, and critical thinking.
Experimental studies, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses.
Studies in English (unless multilingual research is needed).
Exclusion Criteria (What to exclude)
Opinion articles, blog posts, or non-peer-reviewed sources.
Studies that only focus on general AI ethics without a direct educational link.
Studies that focus purely on AI programming without discussing learning impacts.


Step 4: Conduct the Literature Search
Run searches on chosen databases.
Apply filters (e.g., publication date, peer-reviewed).
Export citations to a reference manager like Zotero, Mendeley, or EndNote.
Remove duplicates before proceeding.
Step 5: Screen and Select Papers
Title and Abstract Screening
Read abstracts to determine relevance.
Full-Text Screening
Download and read papers that passed the initial screening.
Apply inclusion/exclusion criteria.
Step 6: Extract Data and Organise Findings
Create a data extraction table to systematically record key study details:

<h1> Week 5 </h1>
<p>3 methods to AI Language Model

1st one i have actually done and will mention i have built it in the report. Other 2 i will propose and discuss in depth in the report but wont say i am going to try them out.
1️⃣ Easiest – Using OpenAI's Custom GPT (ChatGPT-based Model)
✅ No coding required – You just configure the GPT through the OpenAI UI with a system prompt.
✅ Fastest to deploy – Can be set up within minutes.
✅ No infrastructure needed – Hosted by OpenAI.
❌ Limited customisation – You can’t fine-tune it with external data or train it on new datasets.

2️⃣ Moderate Difficulty – Using OpenAI’s GPT-4 Fine-Tuning API
✅ More customisation than a Custom GPT – You can upload a dataset with structured prompts/responses.
✅ Easier than open-source fine-tuning – No need for deep ML knowledge or GPU resources.
❌ Requires preparing training data in JSONL format – Needs a structured dataset for fine-tuning.
❌ Costs money – Fine-tuning with OpenAI incurs costs based on API usage.

3️⃣ Hardest – Fine-Tuning an Open-Source LLM (LLaMA, Mistral, DeepSeek, etc.)
✅ Full control over the model – You can modify its behavior, dataset, and biases.
✅ Does not rely on OpenAI’s infrastructure – Can be self-hosted.
❌ Requires significant machine learning expertise – You need to train and fine-tune the model using frameworks like Hugging Face, PyTorch, or TensorFlow.
❌ Needs powerful hardware (GPUs) – Running and fine-tuning large models can be computationally expensive.
❌ Time-consuming – Training can take days or weeks depending on dataset size.

Find SLR paper recent which uses AI research tools to find how to express in methods section

Dont worry about word count it can be figured out in the last week </p>



<h1> Week 8 and 9</h1>

<p>Ethics form help SOLVED
Do we have to record  NO
Want to do following diagrams

- entity relationship diagram
- data flow diagram 
- use case diagram
- activity diagram
- sequence diagram
- ux ui prototypes (embedded in LMS like Moodle) </p>


<h1> Week 10</h1>

<p>Proj overview + ADU URIC both stated A/B testing where students receive either Intellectus or ChatGPT - can I change this? 

Yes can change as long as supports hypothesis . try to follow user testing guideline

H1 better for cognitive abilities
H2 better ethical
Measure ethics how? Compare gpt response w student's final answer
Be clear ab what tools you'll use for the experiment
Participants should have the same level of education/skill
Pre-questionnaire to ensure the above (controlled parameters)
Controlled environment + time + setup too
Different topics on both platforms to reduce carryover
5 questions - equal number of types of questions and subject of questions
Methodology should state they use their own prompts
Self-reported questionnaire (from their experience)
Expert evaluation on same (using answered paper)
For student questionnaire, give meaning of ability in brackets
For expert, a table (miss engie will send template)
Observed- Measure time/attempts for each task (this will give higher confidence in hypothesis despite few participants) (you are getting proof from different perspectives- TRIANGULATION) (also, can do further testing in future)


Should i include a glossary for both students and experts for their evaluation/survey

What kind of data analysis to do- are certain tools preferred over others? Should use R to make graphs or excel or power bi or tableau or only use tables/formulae? 
Descriptive statistics doesnt give statistically proven result
You need larger number of participants 
But put in discussion that you acknowledge low participants and not statistically significant . However (insert research that supports your method)
In future work put that others can replicate this testing to further test the hypothesis
Prioirtity is to report all participants 
Can also discuss any carryover effect or too similar backgrounds 

Also discuss ethical clearance before hypothesis in method section
Word cloud/sentiment analysis for the qualitative/open ended questions? 
Can do sentiment analysis (and even word cloud) using a tool (report the tool)
State reasons for each part of method
What do I expect for and how do I prepare for the viva
Want to know sam ething youve doen in report 
What is the research you have done
What is your goal
7 minutes most important- your audience dont know the work
30 seconds explain the thing and motivation
Then significance of the literature and highlight importnat things (like cognitive abilities) and other findings (put a picture liek tree)
Then you made intellectus and testing (v1 and v2 and v3) narrate that briefly how you moved from versions
Then we had intellectus and chatgpt to test the hypothesis at the beginning
Then you did a systematic A/B testing 
And important to show your contribution and result, outcomes
Contributions
Designed an LLM model
Proved that intellectus is doing better on cognitive, ethical etc hypothesis except (insert any disproven hypothesis) </p>
