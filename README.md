### **README - Intellectus Portfolio Website**  

## **Project Overview**  
This repository contains the **Intellectus Portfolio Website**, a structured digital portfolio documenting the **research, design, and development** of a generative AI model aimed at **promoting independent student learning**. The website details the project's **objectives, methodology, weekly progress, and meeting logs**, showcasing my work as I build and test an AI-powered educational tool.  

The project focuses on **reducing student dependency on AI for direct answers** by implementing a structured approach that encourages:  
- **Critical thinking**  
- **Problem-solving**  
- **Cognitive development**  

This website serves as a **comprehensive documentation** of my research findings, implementation strategies, and experiment results.
