Project Overview:
This repository contains the Intellectus Portfolio Website, a structured digital portfolio documenting the research, design, and development of a generative AI model aimed at promoting independent student learning. The website details the project's objectives, methodology, weekly progress, and meeting logs while showcasing my work as I build and test an AI-powered educational tool.

The project focuses on reducing student dependency on AI for direct answers by implementing a more structured approach that encourages critical thinking, problem-solving, and cognitive development. This website is intended to document my research findings, implementation strategies, and experiment results.

Website Structure & Pages
1. Home (index.html)
The landing page provides an introduction to the AI Learning Assistant project. It explains the purpose of the website and offers a brief overview of the goals, approach, and motivation behind the research. The homepage also includes a user-friendly navigation bar that links to all key sections of the portfolio.

2. Proposal (proposal.html)
This page outlines the core research question and objectives of the project. It provides an in-depth explanation of:

The problem being addressed (students' over-reliance on AI for academic tasks)
The solution proposed (developing an AI chatbot that promotes guided learning instead of providing direct answers)
The methodology for implementation
My background and relevant experience that supports my ability to carry out the project

3. Weekly Updates (weekly-updates.html)
This section is an information hub for ongoing research, insights, and findings. It acts as a running log where I document:

New resources I come across (academic papers, articles, AI tools)
Conceptual inspirations that influence the development
Challenges and solutions encountered during implementation
Personal notes and reflections for future reference
The Weekly Updates page will provide a transparent view of my research process and help in tracking progress over time.

4. Meeting Logs (meeting-logs.html)
This page contains a structured log of all meetings and discussions related to the project, formatted in a table for easy reference. It includes:

Meeting number and details
Date and time of each discussion
Key discussion points covered in the meeting
Next steps and action items assigned

5. Work in Progress (work-in-progress.html)
This page showcases active developments within the project, including (but NOT limited to):

AI model iterations and testing
Screenshots of chatbot prototypes
Code snippets and technical breakdowns
Experiment setups and preliminary results
