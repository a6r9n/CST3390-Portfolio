        <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <h3></h3>
        <p>The increasing reliance on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education has raised concerns regarding cognitive offloading, automation bias, and the decline of critical thinking and independent problem-solving. Traditional AI language models, such as ChatGPT, primarily function as knowledge providers rather than learning facilitators, promoting passive content consumption. This research introduces Intellectus, a fine-tuned AI language model designed to foster structured inquiry through Socratic questioning and scaffolding techniques.
            Through a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and empirical validation, this study evaluates the cognitive impact of AI on student learning and explores the integration of pedagogically aligned AI frameworks. The project involves the development and assessment of an AI language Model Intellectus via A/B testing, comparing student engagement, problem-solving abilities, and knowledge retention against conventional AI models. The findings contribute to the design of AI-assisted education models that prioritise structured learning, reinforce academic integrity, and reduce AI over-reliance, offering a framework for the ethical and effective integration of AI in academic settings.</p>
            

        <h3>Why:</h3>
        <p>Encouraging students to think critically and develop their own solutions fosters deeper understanding, creativity, and academic integrity. Studies in the <i>Journal of Educational Technology (2024)</i> <a href="https://educationaltechnologyjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41239-023-00411-8" target="_blank">[Read Study]</a> reveal that while AI tools improve efficiency, excessive use risks diminishing deep learning and original thought.</p>
        <p>The <i>Rhode Island Current (2025)</i> <a href="https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/2025/01/06/ai-can-be-a-useful-tool-in-the-classroom-it-can-also-be-a-threat-to-critical-thinking/" target="_blank">[Read Article]</a> warns that AI can either support or hinder critical thinking, depending on how it is implemented in classrooms.</p>

        <h3>How:</h3>
        <p>This project aims to develop a generative AI chatbot tailored for student learning. Instead of giving direct answers, it will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Break down complex questions into structured steps.</li>
            <li>Provide guided frameworks for students to follow.</li>
            <li>Encourage independent thought and problem-solving rather than passive consumption.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By fostering interactive and structured learning, this AI model will empower students to actively engage with their studies while addressing educators' concerns about AI misuse.</p>

        <h2>2. Propose Your Solution Approach</h2>
        <p><strong>Solution Type:</strong> Modelling</p>
        <p>Developing an interactive framework within an AI chatbot to promote guided learning instead of direct answer generation.</p>
