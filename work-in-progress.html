        <h1>Abstract</h1>
        <p>This study presents Intellectus, a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) designed to enhance student cognitive performance, boost knowledge acquisition and mitigate AI over-reliance in education. In contrast to traditional AI tools that provide direct answers, Intellectus engages learners through Socratic questioning, adaptive scaffolding, and structured prompting. Developed using a no-code Custom GPT approach and grounded in a systematic literature review, Intellectus was evaluated through a triangulated methodology combining student self-assessments, expert ratings, and plagiarism analysis. A/B testing with twelve university students showed significant gains across ten higher-order cognitive skills (HOTS) when using Intellectus compared to ChatGPT, alongside a dramatic reduction in plagiarism rates. Expert evaluations further validated these findings, confirming Intellectus’ ability to promote deeper thinking and academic integrity. The research offers a replicable framework for future educational AI models and contributes to the growing discourse on ethical, cognitively aligned AI integration in learning environments.</p>

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>The increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Language Models in education has changed how students engage with and use learning materials, research, and academic problem-solving. Traditional AI language models such as ChatGPT, Google Bard, and DeepSeek have made information retrieval faster and more convenient. These models can generate detailed explanations, summarise complex topics, and assist in academic writing, often mimicking human-like tutoring, but often serve as knowledge providers rather than facilitators of learning, failing to develop deep cognitive engagement (Chan and Hu, 2023). While this accessibility presents opportunities for enhanced learning, it also raises critical concerns about over-reliance on AI.</p>
        <p>This thesis aims to address these concerns by exploring potential AI solutions to help guide educational developers build AI Models that support cognitive development and minimise limitations in present digital solutions. This leads to the development of Intellectus, a prototype AI language model developed specifically to support student learning. Designed as part of this research, Intellectus functions as a facilitator of guided inquiry rather than a provider of direct answers. The development is based on findings from a systematic literature review (SLR) and is followed by empirical experiments to guide iterative testing and refinement of Intellectus to bridge gaps in existing solutions.</p>
      
        <h1>Rationale and Background</h1>
        <p>Many students now bypass cognitive effort by relying on AI-generated responses instead of engaging in critical thinking, reasoning, and problem-solving (Zhai, Wibowo, and Li, 2024). This automation bias (Risko and Gilbert, 2016) encourages students to accept AI-generated information without questioning its validity, while cognitive offloading (Dunn and Risko, 2015) diminishes their retention and critical thinking. Educators and researchers have expressed concerns regarding the long-term implications of this trend in higher-order thinking skills development and academic integrity (Cotton, Cotton, and Shipway, 2023).</p>
      
        <h1>Problem Definition</h1>
        <p>AI language models like ChatGPT are increasingly used in education, yet their design promotes automation bias and cognitive offloading, where students depend on instant answers rather than engaging in critical thinking or reasoning (Zhai, Wibowo, & Li, 2024; Risko & Gilbert, 2016). This overreliance is linked to reduced comprehension, motivation, and long-term learning retention (Ju, 2023; León-Domínguez, 2024; Bai, Liu, & Su, 2023). Although AI can improve short-term performance (Bastani et al., 2024), its current use often undermines independent learning.</p>
        <p>Existing AI tools and Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) tend to act as content providers rather than guided facilitators. They do not aid development of higher-order cognitive skills (Yang et al., 2005; Yatani et al., 2024; Puntambekar & Hubscher, 2005). Instead, they reinforce passive learning, bypassing problem-solving and decision-making processes (Deng & Yu, 2023; Akram et al., 2024).</p>
        <p>Additionally, the inability to track AI-generated content reliably raises risks of plagiarism and ethical misuse (Perkins, 2023; Cotton et al., 2023). Current detection tools are both inaccurate and ethically problematic, prompting calls for prevention-focused design strategies (Ardito, 2023). Most AI tools are designed for consumer use, offering minimal institutional oversight, widening access gaps, and limiting alignment with academic goals (Dolan, 2015; Ahn, 2024).</p>
        <p>Without structured intervention, this unchecked dependency threatens long-term cognition (Sweller, 2019), weakens workforce readiness (Cramarenco et al., 2023), and deepens digital inequality (Furman & Seamans, 2019; Lin et al., 2024).</p>

        <h1>Aims and Objectives</h1>
        <p>This research aims to design, develop, and evaluate a pedagogically aligned AI language model that supports student cognition, fosters independent reasoning, reinforces academic integrity, and mitigates over-reliance on generative AI. The project addresses existing gaps in AI-assisted learning by shifting the model’s role from answer generation to guided inquiry, thereby promoting reflective, skill-based learning.</p>
        <p>To fulfil these aims, the objectives in Fig 1.2 are carried out in this research.</p>

        <h1>Report Structure</h1>
        <p>The remainder of this thesis is organised into structured sections that guide the reader through the research process, beginning with a review of current AI solutions and culminating in the evaluation of the proposed prototype. Each section builds on the previous one, starting with foundational knowledge and literature, followed by implementation, empirical testing, and critical reflection.</p>
