        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>The increasing reliance on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education has raised concerns regarding cognitive offloading, automation bias, and the decline of critical thinking and independent problem-solving. Traditional AI language models, such as ChatGPT, primarily function as knowledge providers rather than learning facilitators, promoting passive content consumption. This research introduces Intellectus, a fine-tuned AI language model designed to foster structured inquiry through Socratic questioning and scaffolding techniques.
            Through a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and empirical validation, this study evaluates the cognitive impact of AI on student learning and explores the integration of pedagogically aligned AI frameworks. The project involves the development and assessment of an AI language Model Intellectus via A/B testing, comparing student engagement, problem-solving abilities, and knowledge retention against conventional AI models. The findings contribute to the design of AI-assisted education models that prioritise structured learning, reinforce academic integrity, and reduce AI over-reliance, offering a framework for the ethical and effective integration of AI in academic settings.</p>

        <h2>Rationale and Background</h2>
        <p>The increasing use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) Language Models in education has changed how students engage with and use learning materials, research, and academic problem-solving. Traditional AI language models such as ChatGPT, Google Bard, and DeepSeek have made information retrieval faster and more convenient. These models can generate detailed explanations, summarise complex topics, and assist in academic writing, often mimicking human-like tutoring, but often serve as knowledge providers rather than facilitators of learning, failing to develop deep cognitive engagement (Chan and Hu, 2023). While this accessibility presents opportunities for enhanced learning, it also raises critical concerns about over-reliance on AI.
            Many students now bypass cognitive effort by relying on AI-generated responses instead of engaging in critical thinking, reasoning, and problem-solving (Zhai, Wibowo, and Li, 2024). This automation bias (Risko and Gilbert, 2016) encourages students to accept AI-generated information without questioning its validity, while cognitive offloading (Dunn and Risko, 2015) diminishes their ability to retain, analyse, and synthesise knowledge. Educators and researchers have expressed concerns regarding the long-term implications of this trend, particularly in higher-order thinking skills development, metacognition, and academic integrity (Cotton, Cotton, and Shipway, 2023).
            This thesis aims to address these concerns by proposing a guided framework to help guide educational developers build AI Models that support cognitive development and minimise limitations in present digital solutions. It also introduces Intellectus, a prototype AI language model developed specifically to support student learning. Designed as part of this research, Intellectus functions as a facilitator of guided inquiry rather than a provider of direct answers. The development is based on findings from an ongoing systematic literature review (SLR) and empirical experiments, to incorporate some existing recommendations from studies in philosophy, pedagogy, and cognitive science, as well as to guide iterative testing and refinement of Intellectus to bridge gaps in existing solutions.</p>
        <h3>State of The Art</h3>
        <p>Developments in Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS), AI educational assistants, and Adaptive Learning Algorithms have significantly improved student access to academic support (Ramteja Sajja et al., 2023). These tools and frameworks are often integrated into learning platforms like Quizlet, Jungle AI, and Khan Academy, and use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to provide students with interactive feedback and personalised content.
            However, recent studies suggest that reliance on AI-based educational tools is negatively impacting student cognition. Zhai, Wibowo, and Li (2024) highlight a decline in problem-solving abilities and deep engagement due to AI-generated responses replacing human-led inquiry. The increasing prevalence of instant AI-generated solutions has shifted students away from constructive learning towards passive consumption, creating risks of surface-level understanding rather than deep comprehension. 
            Additionally, most AI-based educational platforms are designed primarily as direct-to-consumer (B2C) products, which sometimes offer institutional access or programs for educators, where students independently access and use these tools. This model may present two main limitations: accessibility and effectiveness. Students from underprivileged backgrounds or institutions with strict AI restrictions may lack access to these tools, further widening the digital divide (Dolan, 2015). Second, allowing students to use AI tools independently without institutional oversight often leads to unregulated usage patterns where students prioritise convenience over meaningful engagement (Ahn, 2024).
            In pedagogical research, Dunn and Risko (2015) and Risko and Gilbert (2016) have emphasised that cognitive offloading- delegating complex thinking to external sources- impairs metacognition, making students less aware of how to approach, analyse, and synthesise information independently. As a result, the current generation of AI-powered education lacks mechanisms to support structured reasoning, stepwise inquiry, and self-directed cognitive engagement.

        <h2>f</h2>
        <p>This project aims to develop a generative AI chatbot tailored for student learning. Instead of giving direct answers, it will:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Break down complex questions into structured steps.</li>
            <li>Provide guided frameworks for students to follow.</li>
            <li>Encourage independent thought and problem-solving rather than passive consumption.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By fostering interactive and structured learning, this AI model will empower students to actively engage with their studies while addressing educators' concerns about AI misuse.</p>
